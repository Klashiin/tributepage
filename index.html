          "Bill Gates is a technologist, business leader, and philanthropist. He
          grew up in Seattle, Washington, with an amazing and supportive family
          who encouraged his interest in computers at an early age. He dropped
          out of college to start Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul
          Allen."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Bio">
          "Today, Bill co-chairs the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with
          Melinda French Gates, where he works to give his wealth back to
          society. Bill grew up in Seattle with his two sisters. His late
          father, William H. Gates Sr., was a Seattle attorney and one of the
          co-chairs of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. His late mother,
          Mary Gates, was a schoolteacher, University of Washington regent, and
          chairwoman of United Way International. Bill has three children."
